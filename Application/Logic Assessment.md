**1.Why is Susannah going to the Harvard Market QFC most of the time?**

It *could* be force of habbit. Also, most companies are focused on improving their sales or services based on informaton gleaned from meta data. In other words our habbits in statistical form.

**2.How did you arrive at that answer?**

It is easy to let your habbits take you on an auto pilot trip. Having lived on Capital Hill at one point, I did the same...mostly when I was to tired to think strait.

**3.What other possible explanations are there?**

It *could* have been that she walked to the station and was delayed by cross walks just enough to have that affect her schedule.

It *could* have been that she rides a surface street bus to the station and had that prior bus schedule affect her timing.

It *could* have been that there was a cute check out worker at the Harvard Market that she is drawn to.

It *could* have been closer to other places she liked to visit while in the area.

It *could* be a lot of other things. However, there is *no correct answer to this question at this time*. It does not provide enough information to make a solid conclusion. More study would be required.

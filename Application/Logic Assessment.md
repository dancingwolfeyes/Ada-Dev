**1.Why is Susannah going to the Harvard Market QFC most of the time?**

It *could* be force of habit. 

**2.How did you arrive at that answer?**

It is easy to let your habits take you on an 'auto pilot trip'. Having lived on Capital Hill at one point, I did the same...mostly when I was to tired to think strait. Also, most companies are focused on improving their sales or services based on information gleaned from meta data. In other words our habits in statistical form.

**3.What other possible explanations are there?**

It *could* have been that she walked to the station and was delayed by cross walks just enough to have that affect her schedule.

It *could* have been that she rides a surface street bus to the station and had that prior bus schedule affect her timing.

It *could* have been that there was a cute worker at the Harvard Market that she is drawn to.

It *could* have been closer to other places she liked to visit while in the area.

It *could* be a lot of other things. However, there is *no correct answer to this question at this time*. The scenario does not provide enough information to make a solid conclusion. More study would be required.
